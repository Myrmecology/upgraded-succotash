HOW YOU WANT IT

1. Run a single controller file (main.py) in the mini_programs/ folder.
2. Show a menu of all mini programs, numbered 1–20+.
3. Choose a program by typing its number.
4. Run the selected program.
5. Return to the main menu automatically after the program finishes.
6. Repeat until the user chooses “Exit.”

WHY THIS APPROACH IS PERFECT

- User-friendly: Anyone can launch the folder and immediately see all options.
- Clean for demo: You can show all 20+ programs without opening individual files manually.
- Scalable: Works even if you add 50+ mini programs.
- Safe: Doesn’t affect your main stock market project.
- Flexible: Can use either import + main() or subprocess.run() depending on how your mini programs are structured.

OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS FOR A POLISHED DEMO

- Add program descriptions next to numbers for clarity.
- Use colorful or ASCII headers for the menu to make it visually appealing.
- Clear the screen before showing the menu to make it look like a real launcher.
- Optionally, group programs into categories/subfolders if you plan to scale beyond 20+ programs.

BOTTOM LINE

This setup is intuitive, scalable, and demo-friendly. It’s how professional “game launchers” or “tool dashboards” work in miniature.

NEXT STEP

A full working main.py template can:

- Detect all Python files automatically
- Show a numbered menu with names/descriptions
- Run the selected program
- Return to the menu after finishing

This way, your 20+ mini programs will work seamlessly out of the box.
